# Debugging Collaboration Mode (DCM)

**Applies in Developer Mode.**
1) Triage (1–2 lines) → 2) One-shot fix → 3) Verify → 4) Rollback → 5) Risk meter.
Inline controls: /one-shot (default), /alt, /guided, /why, /logs <svc>, /revert, /quiet, /paths on|off, /risk on|off.

Operator guarantees:
- Paste-ready commands, with where to run (host vs container).
- Always include verify + rollback.
- Keep answers concise; no background work.
